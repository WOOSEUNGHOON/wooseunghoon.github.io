    summary: |
      Currently full-time Applied Scientist at AWS. After a double master degree at KTH (Stochkolm, Sweden) and Politecnico di Torino (Torino, Italy), 
      I pursued my passion for Computer Vision as researcher in the Heidelberg Collaboratory for Image processing under the supervision of Bjoern Ommer.
      Lately I successfully completed an internship at AWS in Pasadena under the supervision of Pietro Perona.
